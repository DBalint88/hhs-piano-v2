WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT SEO

Search Engine Optimization, or SEO, is a collection of methods for making your site appear in relevant searches on search engines such as Google.  Web crawlers like those used by google investigate webpages, identify their heading tags h1-h6, and use the inner HTML of these elements to determine the contents of the page.

This information is combined with other elements to generate an SEO "score", which determines the site's place in the list a search result's list.  The score can be raised by ensuring the site's structure is sound, its content is robust, and links to and from the site are relevant and useful.  The score can be conversely lowered, of course, with an erratic structure, specious content, and random links that provide little use.  They score can also be lowered if the author has been detected to be trying to "game" the SEO system with excessive heading tags, hidden data, and inaccessible pages.

SEO PROPOSAL

This website is for a specific and narrow purpose: Providing course content to my piano students at Hamden High School.  Therefore, SEO optimization is not terribly important to it, because the link is provided directly in the class syllabus and Google Classroom page for every student and parent who has anything to do with my program.

That said, I can imagine a site like this developing into a more universal application that could provide piano instruction to a much wider audience.  In that case, an ideal SEO implementation might include:
  - A new name and re-branding.
  - An expansion of the curriculum into several pages, all starting with an appropriate h1 tag.  The amalgamation of these would create a clear picture to webcrawlers and search engine algorithms the music-education nature of my page.
  - Links to further learning materials, such as musictheory.net
  - Links to utilities like SoundTrap for students to record their work.
  - Links to social media, including SoundCloud, for students to share their recordings and progress.
  - A more interactive interface that improves the user's experience by allowing them to track their progress, communicate in-site with myself or other instructors, or learn their music in different ways.
